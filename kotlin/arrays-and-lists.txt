Array -> non-resizable array of elements, read-write
List -> non-resizable object storing many elements of the same type, read-only
ArrayList -> resizable object storing many elements of the same type, read-write

Changing elements in Array is much faster than in ArrayList:
     - bubble sort on 10 elemnts in Array took 17504 nanoseconds
     - bubble sort on 10 elemnts in ArrayList took 153891 nanoseconds

It's better to use ArrayList if we want to add new things to array, than 
    using regular Array, creating new longer, copying all items and changing reference.
