* Best Time Complexity: **O(n * log(n))**
  
* Average Time Complexity: **O(n * log(n))**
  
* Worst Time Complexity: **O(n * log(n))**
  
* Auxiliary Space: **O(n)**
  
* Applications
    * Merge Sort is useful for sorting linked lists.
  
    * Inversion Count Problem - inversions are pairs of numbers, in 
        a disordered list, where the larger of the two numbers is to the 
        left of smaller number.

    * Used in External Sorting - a class of sorting algorithms that can 
        handle massive amounts of data. External sorting is required when 
        the data being sorted do not fit into the main memory of a 
        computing device (usually RAM) and instead they must reside in 
        the slower external memory, usually a hard disk drive.
