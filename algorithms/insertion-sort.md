#### Bubble sort: [(link)][1]
* Best Time Complexity: **O(n)**.

* Average Time Complexity: **O(n * 2*)**.

* Worst Time Complexity: **O(n * 2)**. 

* Auxiliary Space: **O(1)**.

* Application: 
    * Insertion sort is used when number of elements is small. 

    * It can also be useful when input array is almost sorted, only few elements are 
        misplaced in complete big array.
