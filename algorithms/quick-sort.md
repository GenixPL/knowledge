#### Quick sort: [(link)][1]
* Best Time complexity: **O(n * log(n))**
  
* Average Time complexity: **O(n * log(n))**

* Worst Time Complexity: **O(n ^ 2)**. Worst case occurs when the 
    partition process always picks greatest or smallest element as pivot.

* Auxiliary Space: **O(1)**
  
* Applications
    * If your application is not listed in other sort, then use quick sort.
