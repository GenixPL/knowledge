#### Heap sort: [(link)][1] [(link)][2]
* Best Time Complexity: **O(n)**.

* Average Time Complexity: **O(n * log(n))**.

* Worst Time Complexity: **O(n * log(n))**. 

* Auxiliary Space: **O(1)**.

* Application: 
    (on average quick and merge sorts are faster than heap sort)

    * Heap sort has better worst-case time than quicksort, which may be hetpful for handling 
        large data

    * Heap sort sorts in place, and typically runs faster than merge sort on machines with 
        small or slow data caches (but merge sort has many other benefits)
