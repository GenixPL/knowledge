#### Bubble sort: [(link)][1]
* Best Time Complexity: **O(n)**. 
    Best case occurs when array is already sorted.

* Average Time Complexity: **O(n * n)**.

* Worst Time Complexity: **O(n * n)**. 
    Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.

* Auxiliary Space: **O(1)**.

* Application: 
    * In computer graphics it is popular for its capability to detect
        a very small error (like swap of just two elements) in 
        almost-sorted arrays and fix it with just linear complexity.
