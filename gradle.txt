TIP: if task is named in camelCase, then it's enough to write first letters of word, in order to run it (e.g. gradle cK -> gradle compileKotlin)
TIP: build/reports/tests/test/index.html has tests output presented in nice html way 
TIP: gradle vs gradlew -> when we use gradle we are running commands on gradle app installed on our computer, while gradlew executes them from wrapper attached to project
TIP: minimum gradle setup is creating 'build.gradle.kts' and 'settings.gradle.kts'
TIP: adding 'publishAlways()' to 'buildScan' task automagically adds '--scan' to each task

ERROR: if gradle throws `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace` -> it has opened too many processes and runned out of memory
