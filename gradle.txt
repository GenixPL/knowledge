TIP: if task is named in camelCase, then it's enough to write first letters of word, in order to run it (e.g. gradle cK -> gradle compileKotlin)
TIP: build/reports/tests/test/index.html has tests output presented in nice html way 
TIP: gradle vs gradlew -> when we use gradle we are running commands on gradle app installed on our computer, while gradlew executes them from wrapper attached to project


ERROR: if gradle throws `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace` -> it has opened too many  processes and runned out of memory

gradle wrapper

gradle properties

gradle clean
